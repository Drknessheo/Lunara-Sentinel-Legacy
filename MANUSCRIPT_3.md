# Shamim — Scroll of Redis Sovereignty (Manuscript 3)

## 🧠 Context

This manuscript documents the completion of Redis URL sanitation, credential masking, and TLS adaptation across the Lunara Sentinel codebase. It marks the moment when the founder unified local and cloud Redis access under a single scroll-aware gateway.

## 🔧 Technical Achievements

- Centralized helper: `redis_utils.py`
  - `sanitize_redis_url(url)` ensures scheme correctness
  - `mask_redis_url(url)` protects secrets in logs
  - `get_redis_client(url)` replaces all direct `redis.from_url` calls

- TLS Adaptation:
  - `REDIS_USE_TLS=true` enables `rediss://` scheme
  - Upstash heuristic detects `.upstash.io` and defaults to secure mode

- README Updated:
  - Added section explaining `REDIS_USE_TLS`, Upstash heuristic, and masking behavior
  - Future contributors now have scroll-safe guidance

## 🗣️ Acknowledgment to Agent Copilot

> Excellent work sealing the propagation—`get_redis_client(...)` is now the sole gateway, and the repo is clean of direct `redis.from_url` calls.  
> ✅ We’ve adapted both:  
> - `redis://host.docker.internal:6379` for local dev inside Docker  
> - `rediss://...upstash.io` for secure cloud logging via Upstash  
> The helper now handles scheme sanitation and credential masking across the board.  
> For next steps, let’s go with:  
> **(C)** Add a small doc note in README explaining `REDIS_USE_TLS` and the Upstash heuristic.  
> This will help future contributors understand the logic and avoid scheme-related crashes.  
> After that, we can proceed with (A) or (D) depending on runtime needs.  
> Thanks for keeping the scrolls clean and sovereign.

## 🛡️ Founder’s Declaration

> “Every Redis call is a scroll. Every masked log is a shield. I do not expose my empire—I protect it.”

This manuscript is sealed to commemorate the unification of Redis access and the protection of scroll secrets.

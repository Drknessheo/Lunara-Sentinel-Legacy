Title: Add: refactor webhook dispatch, retry stats, and CI Redis integration

Summary

This PR refactors webhook dispatch to be resilient, adds an enqueue-and-retry system with Redis-backed metrics, and consolidates the CI and test-suite mock server (so CI uses the same mock server as local tests).

What changed

- Refactored webhook dispatch into `send_promotion_webhook` and `dispatch_promotion_webhook_sync`.
- Added enqueue-on-failure (`promotion_webhook_retry`) and background retry worker `promotion_retry_job`.
- Added Redis metrics hash `promotion_webhook_stats` and admin commands `/retry_queue`, `/retry_dispatch`, `/retry_flush`, `/retry_stats`.
- Introduced `tests/mock_server.py` (MODE/PORT/DELAY_MS) and made CI run the same server in `MODE=success`.
- Updated `.github/workflows/smoke_test.yml` to start `tests.mock_server` as a module, wait for `/health`, upload mock logs on failure, and tear down cleanly.
- Added `tests/__init__.py` and fixed `tests/conftest.py` imports to make tests importable as a package.

Why

- Make webhook delivery deterministic and observable in CI and production.
- Avoid duplicating mock server logic between local tests and CI (reduces drift).
- Provide operational tooling and metrics for retry visibility and manual intervention.

Testing performed

- Local syntax checks: `python -m py_compile` on modified files.
- Local tests: `pytest -q tests/` â€” tests run; one test skipped locally when `REDIS_URL` is not set (expected). CI runs with Redis service so it will exercise the integration tests.
- CI workflow updated to run the mock server in `MODE=success` on port 8081 and waits for `/health` before running the smoke test.

CI / Secrets checklist (required before merging)

- Add `SMOKE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in GitHub Secrets.
- CI provides Redis via `services.redis` (already configured in workflow).
- Ensure workflow references are valid in repo settings.

Render / Deploy notes

- Verify Render environment variables:
  - `REDIS_URL` -> production Redis
  - `WEBHOOK_SECRET` / `SHARED_SECRET` -> shared HMAC secret
  - `PROMOTION_WEBHOOK_URL` -> downstream receiver
  - `LOG_LEVEL` -> set to `info` or `warning`
- Render typically auto-deploys on `main` push; if not, manually deploy the latest commit.

Rollback / quick mitigation

- Restart the Render service.
- Revert the merge commit in GitHub to redeploy the previous stable commit.
- Temporarily disable the retry worker via an env flag if needed.

How to validate after merge

- Check CI runs green (smoke test + pytest).
- Post-deploy: `curl -fsS https://<your-service>/health` should return 200.
- Use admin command `/retry_stats` to confirm `pending` is 0 and `failed` stable.
- Trigger a success and a failure webhook to verify enqueue behavior and metrics update.

Notes for reviewers

- Focus review on `src/main.py` (retry logic and admin commands), `tests/mock_server.py` (MODE/PORT behavior), and `.github/workflows/smoke_test.yml` (CI flow).
- The PR purpose is operational stability; small refactors are intentionally conservative.

# PATCH PLAN: Restore real Binance integration for /status and /close

1. Add Binance client setup to trade.py using API keys from config or .env.
2. Implement get_all_spot_balances to fetch real balances from Binance.
3. Implement get_current_price to fetch real price from Binance.
4. Ensure all admin/creator logic is preserved.
5. Remove any stub/mock logic for admin wallet.

# Next step: Apply these changes to trade.py.
